LOREKEEPER'S NOTE: The Incident at Archive Level Seven
Recorded: 3rd day of Winter's Depth
Incident Classification: Minor - Protocol Breach (Human Error)
Junior Archivist Pip enthusiastically "optimized" the cross-referencing system on Archive Level Seven this morning. By noon, three centuries of carefully maintained categorical relationships had been reduced to what he cheerfully described as "a much more efficient alphabetical structure."
Elder Scribe Maren found him six hours later, ink-stained and panicking, trying to manually restore the connections. The Tower, in what I can only describe as gentle mockery, had begun randomly re-shelving books to hint at the proper organizational logic. Pip noticed. Eventually.
The Pattern:
This is the fourth time in three months Pip has "improved" something he didn't fully understand. Each incident teaches him something valuable—at the cost of hours of repair work.
Historical Parallel:
During the Great Reckoning, a well-meaning Ministry official "streamlined" the authentication protocols because the old system seemed unnecessarily complex. The evolved threat walked through the gaps within hours.
The Lesson:
Complexity often exists for reasons lost to documentation. Before simplifying, ask why it was complicated in the first place.
Real-World Parallel:
