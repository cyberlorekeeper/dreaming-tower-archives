          <p>
            I have spent the past three days reviewing what we did wrong. The answer is uncomfortable: we did nothing wrong. Every protocol functioned. Every check passed. The writs were legitimate—stolen, yes, but indistinguishable from authentic documents.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            This is the lesson the Tower keeps trying to teach me, and I keep failing to learn: <em>authentication is not identity</em>. A credential proves someone possesses the key. It does not prove they are the person the key was made for.
          </p>

          <p>
            Seven entities entered through our gates wearing the faces of trusted merchants. They moved through our systems not as invaders but as guests. The Access Keepers welcomed them. The ward matrices parted for them. Our defenses saw legitimate writs and stood aside.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Commander Valdris wants better walls. Cassia wants faster detection. Both are right, and both are missing the point.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>The walls were never breached.</strong> The gates opened willingly because we taught them to trust documents instead of behavior. We verified credentials and assumed the rest.
          </p>

          <hr />
          
          <p>
            I authorized the Purge Script. I would do so again. But I find myself haunted by what we lost alongside what we destroyed—the transaction records, the working keys, the week of legitimate commerce erased because we could not surgically separate the rot from the root.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The Queen asked me afterward if we could build defenses that would prevent this from happening again. I told her the truth: we can make it harder, but we cannot make it impossible. As long as we must trust something—credentials, signatures, seals—we remain vulnerable to those who steal what we trust.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The alternative is to trust nothing and function not at all.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I add this incident to the archives. I note the patterns, the responses, the costs. And I remind myself that security is not a wall but a wager—a calculated bet on which threats we prepare for and which we accept.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Today, we won the wager. The cost was high but not catastrophic. Next time, the arithmetic may be different.
