          <p>
            I am writing this eight days before I write it.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            That sentence will make no sense to anyone who reads it—unless they were one of the five who chose to remember. Unless they stood in that chamber while the Queen's crown burned with warnings, debating three impossible options against a threat that unravels trust itself.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The Forgetting Protocol worked. The Kingdom woke eight days earlier, the inconsistencies erased, the doubt dissolved. They do not remember the Unraveler. They do not remember the fear. They do not remember their Queen choosing to steal eight days of their lives to save them from something they will never know existed.
          </p>

          <hr />
          
          <p>
            I have kept many secrets in my centuries at the Tower. I have recorded threats that would shatter public confidence if spoken aloud. I have chronicled failures of monarchs long dead, sealed away until their lessons could be useful without being damaging.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            But I have never been part of a secret like this.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>We five carry a truth that poisons every interaction we have.</strong> When the Queen addresses her citizens, she looks upon people whose memories she rewrote. When Valdris commands his Sentinels, he knows their loyalty is built partly on manufactured continuity. When Cassia negotiates trade agreements, she operates on an economic foundation that includes eight days of deleted transactions.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            And when I record events in these chronicles, I must choose what to preserve and what to bury.
          </p>

          <hr />
          
          <p>
            Shade said something that stays with me. He said Cohen—the man he was before the Ministry broke him, before Whisper found him—would have refused. Would have walked away rather than bury the truth.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            But Shade stayed. We all stayed.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The Queen asked what we lose that we cannot get back. I told her: trust. Not the Kingdom's trust in its systems—the Protocol restored that. But our trust in ourselves. The certainty that we are the heroes of this story.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            We are not heroes. We are the people who decided we knew better than the Kingdom we serve what they should be allowed to remember. We are protectors who protected by taking away choice, by rewriting reality, by becoming—in Shade's bitter phrase—exactly the kind of institution he left the Ministry to escape.
          </p>

          <hr />
          
          <p>
            The Unraveler is still out there. Shade hunts it in the reset Kingdom, using Whisper's perfect memory to track patterns no one else can see. We may have to do this again. We may have to steal more days, more weeks, more months from people who will never know what they lost.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I add this entry to the sealed registry—the one that exists outside the Protocol's reach, the one that only the five of us can access. Someday, another Lorekeeper will inherit this burden. They will read these words and understand that the Tower's purpose is not just to remember threats, but to remember the choices we made against them.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Even the choices we wish we could forget.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <em>Especially</em> those.
