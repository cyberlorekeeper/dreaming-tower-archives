            Six months. The corruption flowed through official channels for six months before anyone noticed. Not because the defenses were weak—they were formidable. Not because the watchers were asleep—they were vigilant. But because they were watching the <em>wrong things</em>.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The compromised component was small. Ubiquitous. Trusted precisely because it seemed too insignificant to weaponize. A scribe's inkwell, not a siege engine. Who guards the inkwells?
          </p>

          <p>
            I have recorded this pattern before. In the chronicles, Merchant-Lord Cassia faces the same impossible arithmetic: <strong>you cannot secure what you do not monitor, but monitoring everything is impossible</strong>. The Council debates the same poisoned choices our world faces now.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Shut down all imports? The economy collapses. Trust existing suppliers? That is the breach vector. Inspect everything? Trade velocity dies, and competitors who accept more risk will devour you.
          </p>

          <hr />
          
          <p>
            The shadow guilds understand our trust topology better than we do. They know which components we consider "low-risk." They know which vendors we wave through because questioning them feels paranoid. They exploit not our weaknesses but our <em>reasonable assumptions</em>.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Security decisions always involve risk acceptance. The question is not "how do we eliminate all supply chain risk"—that is impossible and pursuing it leads to paralysis. The question is: <strong>which risks are we accepting, and do we know we are accepting them?</strong>
          </p>

          <hr />
          
          <p>
            I leave these questions for the councils of your realm to consider:
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Do you have an inventory of every third-party component in your kingdom's foundations? Are your "low-risk" vendors actually monitored differently, or have you simply decided not to look? How long would corruption flow before you noticed? And have you ever practiced the decision framework for when a trusted ally is compromised?
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The inkwell sits on every desk. No one is watching it.
          </p>
