Yet the archives now record a sobering failure: for nearly six full moons, one of the realm's most trusted financial stewards unknowingly left their clients' most intimate records exposed to any who might stumble upon them.","The breach arose not from external assault or deliberate betrayal, but from a flaw in the steward's own record-keeping enchantments. A software error-that most modern of curses-caused what should have been a routine process of evaluating loan applications to expose far more than intended. Names, addresses, and most critically, the identifying marks that distinguish one citizen from all others lay bare and accessible.","What transforms this from mere misfortune to genuine tragedy is the duration: six moons of exposure means thousands of application attempts, each one potentially viewing records that should have remained sealed. The steward discovered their error only through internal audit-raising the uncomfortable question of how many similar failures might continue unnoticed in other halls of finance.","This incident reminds us that in an age of automated record-keeping, the greatest vulnerabilities often lie not in the strength of our locks, but in the complexity of our mechanisms. The most trusted stewards can become unwitting betrayers of the very secrets they swore to protect, undone not by malice but by the intricate enchantments they depend upon to serve their clients' needs."],"has_hr":false,"slug":"the-stewards-broken-seal"}}
