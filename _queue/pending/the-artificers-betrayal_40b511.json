Within a span of five weeks-barely longer than a harvest moon's cycle-this figure managed to breach six hundred protective wards across fifty-five kingdoms.","What marks this incursion as particularly noteworthy is not merely its scope, but the artificer's method. They employed what the scrolls describe as 'generative mystical services'-the same enchanted insights that kingdom defenders use to strengthen their own wards and divine new protections. Here we witness the fundamental duality of all powerful magic: the force that builds may also destroy, the wisdom that protects may also corrupt.","The targeted wards were not common barriers, but sophisticated constructs meant to guard the very pathways between kingdoms-the trade routes and communication channels upon which prosperity depends. Yet no flaw in the ward-craft itself enabled this breach. Rather, the artificer exploited the eternal weakness that no enchantment can seal: the failure to tend what has already been built.","What chills the blood is the speed of corruption once amplified by mystical artifice. Where once such an assault might have taken seasons or years of careful probing, the marriage of shadow-craft with generative enchantment compressed the timeline to mere weeks. This suggests we stand at a threshold where the very tools meant to augment our guardians' wisdom may equally serve to multiply the cunning of those who would do harm."],"has_hr":true,"slug":"the-artificers-betrayal"}}
