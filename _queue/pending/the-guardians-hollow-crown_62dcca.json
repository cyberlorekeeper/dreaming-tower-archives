These protectors are granted special privileges: access to the innermost chambers, the ability to move freely through all territories, and most crucially, the unquestioned trust of those they defend.","This winter's chronicles bring word of a guardian order whose very essence was turned against those it protected. The watchers who stood sentinel against corruption found their own sacred rituals - the ceremonies through which they renewed their strength and sharpened their sight - transformed into vectors of the very malevolence they opposed.","The corruption was not crude or obvious. Instead, it followed a patient, multi-stage progression, like a poison that reveals itself slowly through the veins. Those who trusted these guardians received not protection, but a persistent shadow that would burrow deep into their domains, establishing footholds for future exploitation.","This incident illuminates one of our realm's most troubling paradoxes: the more we trust our protectors, the more damage they can inflict when that trust is betrayed. The guardian's access, meant to enable swift response to threats, becomes the very pathway through which new threats enter.","Enterprise domains and humble household systems alike fell victim to this corruption, demonstrating how thoroughly we have come to depend on our defensive enchantments. When the watchers themselves become vectors of corruption, who watches the watchers? This ancient question gains new urgency in our interconnected age."],"has_hr":false,"slug":"the-guardians-hollow-crown"}}
